# CSS Style Guide

This document aims to provide you, the developer, a **standardized way of writing CSS for the committee's existing web development projects**.

While this guide is subjective, you are free to follow it on personal and commercial projects that have little to no relation with this committee.

There are plenty of CSS style guides like this on the Internet. This is one of them.

## Why enforce this guide?

Without a standard, developers working on a software project **create things based on their existing perception**.

This can lead to problems like:

- Inconsistency, for example on the CSS class names and architecture.
- Conflict, two developers with different mindsets on how to approach CSS will have a hard time working with each other.
- Distress, because of the complexity since everybody is "_doing things in their own direction_".

A guide like this rallies developers to one point that they can follow and debate what to agree on.
