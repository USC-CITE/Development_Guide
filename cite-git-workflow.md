# Git Workflow for CITE

Before development, CITE members and contributors must read this document outlining the **Git Workflow for CITE**. 

The process works in 7 steps:
1. [Create a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/USC-CITE/.github/blob/main/how_to_create_an_issue.md). 
2. Create a `git branch` to address the issue.
3. `git commit` changes to branch.
4. `git push` branch to remote repository.
5. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/USC-CITE/.github/blob/main/how_to_submit_a_pull_request.md).
6. Have your pull request reviewed and tested.
7. Approve pull request for merging to `main` branch. 

> ![NOTE]
> CITE members who are assigned tasks (which are under a project) within Notion can ignore the first step.

## How does CITE name branches?

```bash
git branch feature/issue-1/add-home-page
git branch bugfix/no-ref/improve-about-page-responsiveness
git branch hotfix/issue-342/button-overlap-form-on-mobile
git branch test/no-ref/refactor-components-with-atomic-design
```

Dissecting the commands above, the format goes as:

```bash
git branch [category]/[issue-reference]/[description]
```

### Branch Category

A git branch should start with a category. Choosing one depends on the issue you are trying to address. 

CITE pinpointed 5 categories you can use:

- `feature` is for adding, modifying, or removing a feature
- `bugfix` is for fixing a bug
- `refactor` is for refactoring a feature or documentation
- `hotfix` is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
- `test` is for experimenting outside of an issue

### Branch Issue Reference

After the category, there should be a *"/"* followed by the reference of the GitHub issue you are working on. If there's no reference, just add `no-ref`.

### Branch Description

After the reference, there should be another *"/"* followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased".

By default, you can use the title of the issue/ticket you are working on. Just replace any special character by *"-"*.

## How does CITE name commits?

```bash
git commit -m "Add the Home page"
git commit -m "Cut the search bar from the header"
git commit -m "Fix menu of header janking on mobile devices"
git commit -m "Bump NodeJS to 22.0.1"
git commit -m "Make Apache Server use HTTP instead of HTTPS"
git commit -m "Refactor search bar" 
git commit -m "Optimize search bar queries"
```
> ![NOTE] 
> A commit must describe one change only and the subject must be limited to 50 characters. 

Dissecting the examples above, we have the following format:

```bash
git commit -m "[verb] [description]"
```

Verbs to use:
- `Add` = Create a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
- `Cut` = Remove a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
- `Fix` = Fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.
- `Bump` = Increase the version of something e.g. dependency.
- `Make` = Change the build process, or tooling, or infra.
- `Start` = Begin doing something; e.g. create a feature flag.
- `Stop` = End doing something; e.g. remove a feature flag.
- `Refactor` = A code change that MUST only be a refactoring.
- `Reformat` = Refactor of formatting, e.g. omit whitespace.
- `Optimise` = Refactor of performance, e.g. speed up code.
- `Document` = Refactor of documentation, e.g. help files.

The seven rules

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalise the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
